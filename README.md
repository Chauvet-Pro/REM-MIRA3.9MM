# REM-MIRA-3.9mm

The Chauvet Professional REM MIRA 3.9MM comes in 2 flavors-1000x500mm and the 500x500mm. The smaller of the 2 is referred to as the "SQ", or "square" panel. The SQ requires a different version of the software, or NCP file.

## Control Software

Please review the serial number prefix ("A", "B", ect) of your panels. Then, navigate to the appropriate folder for your LED batch. Selecting the incorrect LED batch will cause the color calibration to show incorrectly.

These firmware files are intended to be uploaded with the [Novastar Coex VMP software](https://www.novastar.tech/downloads/).
